# ✅ Legal Integration Complete!

## 🎉 **What I've Done**

I've added Terms of Service and Privacy Policy **directly to your app** with a clean, professional footer - just like you requested!

## 📍 **Where to Find It**

**Location:** Bottom of your main app (after analysis results)

**What users see:**
1. **Privacy guarantee banner** - "Your documents are NEVER stored"
2. **Two buttons** - "📄 Terms of Service" and "🔒 Privacy Policy"  
3. **Trust tagline** - "Complete privacy • Secure payments • Professional analysis"

## 🔍 **How It Works**

1. **Users click the buttons** at the bottom of your app
2. **Expandable sections open** with full legal content
3. **Close buttons** to collapse the sections
4. **Clean, unobtrusive design** that doesn't interrupt the main workflow

## 🔒 **Privacy Focus**

Both documents **heavily emphasize**:
- ✅ **Zero document storage** - Files never saved to servers
- ✅ **Memory-only processing** - Immediate deletion after analysis  
- ✅ **Complete privacy** - No personal data collection
- ✅ **Secure payments** - Industry-standard protection
- ✅ **Minimal data** - Only email and credit balance stored

## 📧 **What You Need to Update**

**Only one thing:** Update the contact email placeholders in your app.py:

```
[your-email@domain.com]
```

Replace with your actual support email address.
