# Process Documents Button Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The Process Documents button was disappearing a few seconds after the initial page load without any user interaction. The button would render correctly initially but then vanish completely after an automatic refresh/re-render.

## Root Cause Analysis
After analyzing the logs and code, the issue was identified as follows:

1. The button was being created correctly on the initial render
2. The code was storing the button placeholder in session state:
   ```python
   st.session_state.process_button_placeholder = process_button_placeholder
   ```
3. When Streamlit re-renders the page (which happens automatically in Streamlit apps), placeholders become invalid
4. The stored placeholder in session state was becoming invalid, causing the button to disappear when referenced

## Solution Implemented
The fix involved removing the line that stores the button placeholder in session state:

**Before:**
```python
# Store the button placeholder in session state for later use in loading states
st.session_state.process_button_placeholder = process_button_placeholder
```

**After:**
```

```

## Why This Fix Works
1. **Always Fresh Creation**: The button is now always created fresh on each render instead of trying to reuse a stored placeholder
2. **Current Context**: All [restore_button](file:///c:/Users/edgar/Documents/GitHub/noianalyzer/noianalyzer/utils/ui_helpers.py#L670-L697) calls in error handling paths already use the current render's [process_button_placeholder](file:///c:/Users/edgar/Documents/GitHub/noianalyzer/noianalyzer/app.py#L4685-L4685) variable, so they continue to work correctly
3. **No Placeholder Invalidation**: By not storing the placeholder in session state, we avoid the issue of placeholder invalidation on re-renders

## Verification
- The button now remains permanently visible in its correct position and style
- The fix is stable across reloads and re-renders
- All functionality is preserved - only the visual/UI persistence was affected
- Error handling paths continue to work correctly using the current render's placeholder

## Files Modified
- `app.py` - Line 4694: Commented out the problematic line that stored the button placeholder in session state

This fix ensures that the Process Documents button will remain visible and functional across all re-renders and page refreshes.
