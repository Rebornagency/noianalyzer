## 1. Create Sentry Account and Project

### Step 1.1: Sign Up for Sentry
1. Go to [https://sentry.io/signup/](https://sentry.io/signup/)
2. Create a free account (starts with 14-day Business trial, then free tier)
3. Choose **United States** for data storage location (or EU if preferred)

### Step 1.2: Create a Python Project
1. Once logged in, click **"Create Project"**
2. Select **"Python"** as your platform
3. Set alert frequency to **"Alert me on high priority issues"**
4. Name your project: **"NOI Analyzer"**
5. Assign to your default team
6. Click **"Create Project"**

### Step 1.3: Copy Your DSN
- **IMPORTANT**: Copy the DSN key shown on the setup page
- It looks like: `https://abc123def456@o789012.ingest.sentry.io/345678`
- You'll need this in the next step

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

The Sentry SDK has already been added to your `requirements.txt` file. To install it:

### Option A: Using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option B: Install Sentry directly
```bash
pip install "sentry-sdk[streamlit]==2.29.1"
```

---

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

### Step 3.1: Create a .env file
Create a file named `.env` in your project root directory (same folder as `app.py`):

```bash
# NOI Analyzer Environment Variables

# OpenAI API Configuration (if you haven't set this already)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Sentry Error Tracking Configuration
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-key@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/789012
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1

# Optional: Set a custom release version
# SENTRY_RELEASE=noi-analyzer@1.0.0
```

### Step 3.2: Replace the placeholder values
- Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key
- Replace `https://your-key@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/789012` with the DSN you copied from Sentry

### Step 3.3: Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Use `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development` while testing
- **Production**: Change to `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production` when deploying
- **Traces Sample Rate**: 
  - `0.1` = Track 10% of transactions (good for development)
  - `0.01` = Track 1% of transactions (recommended for production)

## 4. Test the Integration

### Step 4.1: Run Your Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 4.2: Check the Console
You should see this message in your terminal:
```
INFO - Sentry error tracking initialized successfully
```

If you see this warning instead:
```
WARNING - Sentry error tracking not initialized - check SENTRY_DSN environment variable
```
Double-check your `.env` file and make sure the `SENTRY_DSN` is correct.

### Step 4.3: Test Error Tracking
To test that Sentry is working, you can temporarily add this code to your app and trigger it:

```python
# Add this temporarily for testing
if st.button("Test Sentry (Remove After Testing)"):
    raise Exception("This is a test error for Sentry!")
```

When you click the button, you should see the error appear in your Sentry dashboard within a few seconds.

## 5. Understanding the Dashboard

### Step 5.1: Access Your Dashboard
1. Go to [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Log in to your account
3. Select your "NOI Analyzer" project

### Step 5.2: Key Sections
- **Issues**: Shows all errors and exceptions
- **Performance**: Shows slow operations and transactions
- **Releases**: Track deployments and their impact
- **Alerts**: Configure when to be notified

### Step 5.3: What Gets Tracked Automatically
Your NOI Analyzer now tracks:
- âœ… All unhandled exceptions
- âœ… File upload events
- âœ… Document processing operations
- âœ… Button clicks and user actions
- âœ… Performance of key operations
- âœ… User session information
- âœ… Application startup and errors

---

## 6. Advanced Configuration

### Step 6.1: Production Settings
For production deployment, update your `.env` file:

```bash
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.01  # Lower sampling for production
SENTRY_RELEASE=noi-analyzer@v1.0.0  # Set your app version
```

### Step 6.2: Custom Alerts
1. In Sentry dashboard, go to **Alerts** â†’ **Create Alert**
2. Set up alerts for:
   - High error rates
   - Performance issues
   - New error types

### Step 6.3: Release Tracking
To track releases and associate errors with specific deployments:

```bash
# Set in your deployment environment
SENTRY_RELEASE=noi-analyzer@$(date +%Y.%m.%d)
```

---

## 7. Best Practices

### Step 7.1: Privacy and Security
- âœ… Sensitive data is automatically filtered out
- âœ… Financial data is not sent to Sentry
- âœ… API keys are filtered from error reports
- âœ… Personal information is excluded

### Step 7.2: Error Management
- **Resolve Issues**: Mark issues as resolved in Sentry when fixed
- **Set Ownership**: Assign issues to team members
- **Add Context**: Use the breadcrumbs to understand user actions

### Step 7.3: Performance Monitoring
- Monitor document processing times
- Track slow API calls
- Identify bottlenecks in data analysis

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Sentry not initialized" message
**Solution**: Check that your `.env` file is in the project root and contains the correct `SENTRY_DSN`

### Problem: No errors appear in Sentry
**Solution**: 
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the DSN is correct
3. Try the test error button mentioned in Step 4.3

### Problem: Too many alerts
**Solution**: 
1. Increase `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` 
2. Set up alert rules to filter noise
3. Use issue grouping in Sentry dashboard
