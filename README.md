# NOI Analyzer Updates and Fixes

This document provides an overview of the changes and fixes implemented in the NOI Analyzer application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeError in Data Processing
Fixed the issue where the application would throw a TypeError when processing financial data with nested dictionary structures. The error occurred in the `helpers.py` file when trying to convert dictionary values directly to floats.

### 2. Extraction API URL Configuration
Fixed the issue with the extraction API URL configuration by ensuring the "/extract" endpoint is properly appended to the base URL when making API calls.

### 3. GPT API Integration
Ensured proper integration with the OpenAI GPT API by:
- Hardcoding the API key in both config.py and ai_insights_gpt.py
- Improving error handling and logging for API calls
- Fixing data structure handling to ensure proper data flow between components
