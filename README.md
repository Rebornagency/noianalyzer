# NOI Analyzer Updates and Fixes

This document provides an overview of the changes and fixes implemented in the NOI Analyzer application.

## New Feature: Automated Financial Storyteller

The NOI Analyzer now includes a powerful new feature called the "Automated Financial Storyteller" that automatically generates comprehensive narrative summaries of a property's financial performance.

### Features of the Financial Storyteller:

- **Comprehensive Financial Narratives**: Generates detailed, well-structured narratives that explain the "why" behind the numbers.
- **Multi-Period Analysis**: Analyzes performance against budget, prior month, and year-over-year comparisons.
- **Key Driver Identification**: Automatically identifies and explains the most significant factors impacting NOI performance.
- **Editable Content**: Users can edit the generated narrative to customize it for their specific needs.
- **Exportable**: The narrative can be exported as a text file or included in PDF reports.

### How to Use:

1. Upload your financial documents and process them as usual
2. Navigate to the "Financial Story" tab to view the generated narrative
3. Use the "Edit Narrative" button to customize the text if needed
4. Export the narrative using the "Export Narrative" button

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeError in Data Processing
Fixed the issue where the application would throw a TypeError when processing financial data with nested dictionary structures. The error occurred in the `helpers.py` file when trying to convert dictionary values directly to floats.

### 2. Extraction API URL Configuration
Fixed the issue with the extraction API URL configuration by ensuring the "/extract" endpoint is properly appended to the base URL when making API calls.

### 3. GPT API Integration
Ensured proper integration with the OpenAI GPT API by:
- Hardcoding the API key in both config.py and ai_insights_gpt.py
- Improving error handling and logging for API calls
- Fixing data structure handling to ensure proper data flow between components

## Key Components Updated

### 1. New Components
- **`financial_storyteller.py`**: Core module for generating financial narratives
- **`storyteller_display.py`**: UI components for displaying and editing narratives

### 2. `utils/helpers.py`

### 4. `config.py`
- Updated to prioritize hardcoded API keys
