# DuplicateWidgetID Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
After successfully processing documents and extracting data, the application was encountering a `DuplicateWidgetID` error when trying to restore the Process Documents button. The error message was:

```
streamlit.errors.DuplicateWidgetID: There are multiple widgets with the same `key='main_process_button'`.
To fix this, please make sure that the `key` argument is unique for each widget you create.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple calls to [restore_button](file:///c:/Users/edgar/Documents/GitHub/noianalyzer/noi_analyzer/utils/ui_helpers.py#L670-L697) with the same explicit key `main_process_button`. In Streamlit, each widget must have a unique key within the same session.

When the Process Documents button was initially created, it used the key `main_process_button`. Later, when restoring the button after various operations (document processing, error handling, etc.), the code was explicitly passing the same key, causing the duplicate widget ID error.

## Solution Implemented
The fix involved removing the explicit `key="main_process_button"` parameter from all [restore_button](file:///c:/Users/edgar/Documents/GitHub/noianalyzer/noi_analyzer/utils/ui_helpers.py#L670-L697) calls, allowing the [restore_button](file:///c:/Users/edgar/Documents/GitHub/noianalyzer/noi_analyzer/utils/ui_helpers.py#L670-L697) function to generate unique keys automatically.

The [restore_button](file:///c:/Users/edgar/Documents/GitHub/noianalyzer/noi_analyzer/utils/ui_helpers.py#L670-L697) function in `utils/ui_helpers.py` already has logic to generate unique keys when none is provided:

```python
# If no key is provided, generate a unique key to prevent DuplicateWidgetID errors
if not key:
    import uuid
    key = f"button_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
```

## Files Modified
- `app.py` - Multiple instances fixed:
  1. Line ~4746: Email missing case
  2. Line ~4798: No current month file case
  3. Line ~4847: Testing mode case
  4. Line ~4860: Terms not accepted case
  5. Line ~4872: Email missing in production case
  6. Line ~4931: After document processing case
  7. Line ~4966: Credit system fallback case
  8. Line ~4771: Insufficient credits case

## Specific Changes Made

### Before (causing error):
```python
restore_button(process_button_placeholder, "Process Documents", key="main_process_button", type="primary", use_container_width=True)
```

### After (fixed):
```python
restore_button(process_button_placeholder, "Process Documents", type="primary", use_container_width=True)
```

## Why This Fix Works
1. **Unique Keys**: Each restored button now gets a unique key generated automatically
2. **No DuplicateWidgetID Errors**: Streamlit can properly track each widget without conflicts
3. **Preserved Functionality**: All button functionality remains intact
4. **Consistent with Best Practices**: Follows the Streamlit Application Development and UI Consistency Standards which require unique widget keys

## Verification
- ✅ Process Documents button works correctly after document processing
- ✅ Error handling paths restore buttons properly without errors
- ✅ All functionality is preserved
- ✅ No more DuplicateWidgetID errors in the logs

This fix ensures that the Process Documents button and all related functionality work correctly across all user flows and error scenarios.
